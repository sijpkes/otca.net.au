		<h1>Terminology</h1>
			<p>You should be aware that in the occupational therapy profession different terms have been used to describe reasoning in the last three decades.  Initially Rogers (1983), and Mattingly and Fleming (1991) referred to these processes as clinical reasoning.  This term was a reflection of the medical terminology used in those times and the more restricted contexts where therapists worked.  Later authors changed the terminology to reflect the expanding scope of occupational therapy practice and occupational science in the last two decades.   Terms that have been used were: Therapeutic Reasoning (Kielhofner & Forsyth, 2002) and Professional Reasoning (Schell & Schell, 2007).  As occupational therapy continues to further extend its scope of practice we did not think that these previous terms captured reasoning in all its possible forms and contexts.  We have therefore used the term – Practice Reasoning – to reflect the contemporary scope of the profession and we have set this term into the holistic Occupational Therapy Practice Process framework seen on this website.</p>
