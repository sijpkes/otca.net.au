<h2>Self-Assess Your OTCEM</h2>
<div class='feedback'>
<p>
    Here you self-assess your competency by ticking the OTCEM competency statements have achieved. This will save to your ePortfolio.
</p>
<p>
    Your Practice Educator will verify your self-assessment by agreeing or disagreeing. This is Observable Evidence.

Tick the competency statements that you have achieved then    <a href="#" id='save_otcem'>click here to SAVE and upload to “Your ePortfolio”</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Then get your Practice Educator to verify your self-assessment.
</p>
<p>
    You can also use the Save window to upload Documented Evidence – this is either a description or a piece of hard/documented evidence that supports your
    ticked self-assessment.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        You DO NOT have to add an individual piece of Documented Evidence (description or hard evidence) for EACH ticked competency statement. Consult the
        Course Guide/Outline for your University Occupational Therapy Course for details on how much evidence is required. Check the Important Instruction
        Information link in the box above for further information about this.
