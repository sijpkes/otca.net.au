    This is a read only overview of all the OTCEM competency statements you have self-assessed (ticked) and your Practice Educatorsâ€™ verification. It also
    links to a record of any supporting Documented Evidence (a description or hard/documented evidence) that you have uploaded to your ePortfolio to
    demonstrate how you achieved the ticked competency statements and to build your portfolio of evidence.
</p>
<p>
    This overview is an OTCEM summary of all your placements up to this point where you have used this website. This is a cumulative record of your achieved
    competence.
</p>
<p>
    Use the <strong>'Self-Assess Your OTCEM'</strong> option in "Your Toolbar" to self-assess your competence.
</p>
{if:elseif segment_3 == 'add_evidence'} 
	<p>
    Here you self-assess your competency by ticking the OTCEM competency statements have achieved. This will save to your ePortfolio.
</p>
<p>
    Your Practice Educator will verify your self-assessment by agreeing or disagreeing. This is Observable Evidence.

The OTCEM competency statements are mapped to the Australian Minimum Competency Standards for New Graduate Occupational Therapists (ACSOT) Occupational Therapy Australia, 2010.  
</p>
<p>
They have been mapped and directly linked within the website to the Performance Record for the Australian Competency Standards for Occupational Therapists (PRACSOT) Occupational Therapy Australia, 2010. 
</p>
<p>
	Students can use the OTCEM to self-assess and evidence their developing competence.  Practice Educators use
	the OTCEM to verify the student's self-assessment.
</p>
<p>
Once your competency evidenced within the OTCA Website OTCEM is verified by your practice educator and/or lecturer, they will be automatically be tick-off against the relevant PRACSOT performance criteria at the appropriate Competency Development Level: Emerging, Consolidating and Competent to Graduate.
</p>
<p>
For the purpose of this competency website, and with the permission of OTA, the PRACSOT 'Demonstrated Competence' categories have been amended to reflect the 3 Competency Development Levels.
</p>
<p>If you wish to trial the OTCEM competency matrix please contact 
	<a href='mailto:enquiries@otca.net.au'>enquiries@otca.net.au</a> and we can setup a 
	demonstration account for you.</p>

When you tick the competency statements that you have achieved for each step that you have focused on below, a box will appear
on the left side of the page.  Use this to save and upload your OTCEM self-assessment and any supporting hard evidence/description
to your ePortfolio.
</p>
<p>
    Then get your Practice Educator to verify your self-assessment.
</p>
<p>
    You can also use the Save window to upload Documented Evidence,
    this is either a description or a piece of hard/documented evidence that supports your
    ticked self-assessment.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        You DO NOT have to add an individual piece of Documented Evidence (description or hard evidence) for EACH ticked competency statement. Consult the
        Course Guide/Outline for your University Occupational Therapy Course for details on how much evidence is required. Check the Important Instruction
        Information link in the box above for further information about this.
