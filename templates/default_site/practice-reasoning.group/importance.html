		<h1>Importance</h1>
			<p>It has been well researched that there are differences between qualified occupational therapists who are novice graduates’ ( 0 – 2yrs) and experts’ ( 5+ years) reasoning.  There is less written or researched about students and how they actually develop their practice reasoning from the beginning. But to be “competent at graduation” you have to pass through three different levels of development.  On this website we call these levels: 1) Emerging, 2) Consolidating, and 3) Competent at Graduation.  In all pre-registration programs no matter their length 2 – 4 years or their level, Bachelors or Masters, your thinking and reasoning develops as you integrate your different knowledges and gradually become “critical” about your professional practice thinking and reasoning until you are competent at graduation.</p>
