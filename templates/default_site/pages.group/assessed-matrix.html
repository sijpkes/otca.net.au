    This is a read only overview of all the OTCEM competency statements you have self-assessed (ticked) and your Practice Educatorsâ€™ verification. It also
    links to a record of any supporting Documented Evidence (a description or hard/documented evidence) that you have uploaded to your ePortfolio to
    demonstrate how you achieved the ticked competency statements and to build your portfolio of evidence.
</p>
<p>
    This overview is an OTCEM summary of all your placements up to this point where you have used this website. This is a cumulative record of your achieved
    competence.
</p>
<p>
    Use the <strong>'Self-Assess Your OTCEM'</strong> option in â€˜Your Toolbarâ€™ to self-assess your competence.
</p>
{if:elseif segment_3 == 'add_evidence'} 
	<p>
    Here you self-assess your competency by ticking the OTCEM competency statements have achieved. This will save to your ePortfolio.
</p>
<p>
    Your Practice Educator will verify your self-assessment by agreeing or disagreeing. This is Observable Evidence.

Tick the competency statements that you have achieved for each step that you have focused on then   <a href="#" id='save_otcem'>click here to SAVE and upload to Your ePortfolio</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Then get your Practice Educator to verify your self-assessment.
</p>
<p>
    You can also use the Save window to upload Documented Evidenceâ this is either a description or a piece of hard/documented evidence that supports your
    ticked self-assessment.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        You DO NOT have to add an individual piece of Documented Evidence (description or hard evidence) for EACH ticked competency statement. Consult the
        Course Guide/Outline for your University Occupational Therapy Course for details on how much evidence is required. Check the Important Instruction
        Information link in the box above for further information about this.
