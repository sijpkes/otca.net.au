The student has ticked the competency statements they believe they have achieved for each step below.  
Use the box on the left to save and verify this OTCEM self-assessment and provide feedback to the student.  
This feedback will appear in the student's ePortfolio when they click on this item.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Students DO NOT have to add an individual piece of Documented Evidence (description or hard evidence) for EACH ticked competency statement. Consult the
        Course Guide/Outline for your University Occupational Therapy Course for details on how much evidence is required. Check the Important Instruction
        Information link in the box above for further information about this.
