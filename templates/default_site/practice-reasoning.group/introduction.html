		<h1>Introduction to Practice Reasoning</h1>
			<p>Practice reasoning describes all the thought processes that go through your mind when you work as a therapist in every area of practice no matter what your level of expertise.  Your thinking should include your knowledge, skills and abilities, the expectations of the context where you are working, as well as those of the client who you work with / for.  When you analyse your thoughts and try to integrate them into forming some practice options, you may share these practice reasonings with your practice educator, your team or with your client.  Ultimately, you will narrow down your strategies to make decisions based on these thinking processes.  This is all about your practice reasoning.</p>
			
		<p>It is important for you to be able to explain your practice reasoning to others, particularly your practice educator.  You might find you have to use different language depending on who you are explaining your practice reasoning to.  This may include your client and other team members.  If you can capture these reasonings somehow, they are then evidence of your developing competence.</p>
